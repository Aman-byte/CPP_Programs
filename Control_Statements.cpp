Types of Control Statements in C++:
if-else statement:
if-else statement is used to execute a statement block. It has the following syntax :
if(expression is true
{
 action 1;
}
else 
{
 action 2;
}
switch statement:
It is a multiple branching statement where based on a condition, the control is transferred to one of the many possible points. It has the following syntax :
switch(expression)
{
 case1:
 {
  action 1;
 }
 case 2:
 {
  action 2;
 }
 case 3:
 {
  action 3;
 }
default:
 {
  default statement;
 }
}
for statement:
for is an entry controlled loop. It is used when an action is to be repeated for a predetermined time. It has the following syntax :
for(initial value; test condition; increment or decrement)
{
 action 1;
}
while statement:
It is also a loop control structure but it’s an entry-controlled loop.
It has the following syntax:
while(condition is true)
{
 action 1;
}
action 2;
do-while statement:
do-while is an exit controlled loop based on a condition, the control is transferred back to a particular point in the program. It has the following syntax :
